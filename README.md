# Project Overview
## Introduction
This project is a web-based adaptation inspired by Ali_Muhammed_Ali's Android app. Its primary goal is to address the challenge of procrastination by encouraging users to engage in short but focused work sessions. The unique feature of this application lies in its emphasis on "VERY SMALL" session times, promoting brief but effective work intervals. Additionally, users have the flexibility to extend their sessions, allowing for uninterrupted flow states.

## Motivation
The inspiration for transitioning this app to the web stemmed from a personal experience. During a trip, the loss of my phone charger disrupted my routine of using the original Android app. Faced with this inconvenience, I saw an opportunity to create a web versionâ€”a versatile "achievement_salad" that could be accessed from any device with internet connectivity.

## Key Features
Short Session Times: Encourages users to work in small, manageable intervals to combat procrastination.
Session Extension: Provides the flexibility to extend work sessions based on user preferences and flow states.
Pomodoro Functionality: Incorporates essential features found in traditional Pomodoro apps.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed for ease of use, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
Web Accessibility: Enables users to access the application from any device with internet connectivity.
