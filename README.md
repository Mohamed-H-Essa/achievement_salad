# THE WHY
### this is a clone of an android app by Ali_Muhammed_Ali: it's purpose is to push you into working with a "VERY SMALL" session time to reduce procrastinating at the same time you have the ability to extend the session and needn't cut your flow state if you felt like working plus all the functions provided by the regular pomodoro apps and much much more.

what've motivated me to bring this into the web world was a situation at which i forgot lost my phone charger in a trip which had lead me to spend sometime without using it interrupting my routine of using this app for setting sessions so I said to myself why not making my own "achievement_salad".
